# Making Big Data with Alexa
Based on Amazon's datasets, let's make data analysis and visualization. This project is based on one dataset alone contains over 1.5 million rows; with over 40 datasets.

Use the furnished schemata to create tables in your RDS database.

#  The procedure

- Two separate ZEPL notebooks and extract the list one into each notebook.
- Work with S3 data sources in two separate ZEPL notebooks.
- For each notebook (one dataset per notebook), we can:

   -- Count the number of records (rows) in the dataset.
   -- Transform the dataset to fit the tables in the schema file.
   -- RDS instance.
